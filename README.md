# lyoshenka/ama

A repository to ask me anything.

I founded [TopScore](http://usetopscore.com) in 2011 and worked there as CTO for six years, doing some of everything on the product and leadership side. I now spend most of my time on [LBRY](https://lbry.io), doing many of the same things but with a different twist (more open-source, more blockchains, less bootstrapped).


### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as [creating a new issue](https://github.com/lyoshenka/ama/issues/new) on this project.

I'll try to answer it reasonably quickly. Once I answer, I'll close the
issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry - if you have any further
questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to
ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.


### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/lyoshenka/ama/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try
to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig
into some of the older threads.
